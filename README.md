This is a collection of chef recipies that set up the server for the
Cyclestreets Toolkit. You might need to customise them for your own situation,
and pull requests are very welcome.

# Setup

This is designed to use chef-solo. First we need to grab this repository and
prep the cookbooks, then install chef-solo, then chef can take care of the rest.
The base system is ubuntu-server 11.04 so there's not much installed already.

    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone https://github.com/cyclestreets/toolkit-chef.git
    $ cd toolkit-chef/

(From this point on, we could just make a magic script to do the rest.)

First, we need to bundle up the cookbooks. This comes in handy later on.

    $ tar -czvf cookbooks.tgz cookbooks/

Now, we need to install chef. We're using chef 0.10 from the Opscode apt
repository.

    echo "deb http://apt.opscode.com/ `lsb_release -cs`-0.10 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d
    gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 83EF826A
    gpg --export packages@opscode.com | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/opscode-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install opscode-keyring # permanent upgradeable keyring
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install chef

When you are prompted for the server url, enter "none"

Now we can run chef to take care of everything else. The node.json file
specifies which recipies we want to run

    $ cd ~
    $ sudo chef-solo -j toolkit-chef/node.json -r toolkit-chef/cookbooks.tgz
